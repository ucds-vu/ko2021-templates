<h1>Takeaways for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge Organization</h3>

<p class="counter">
The process of knowledge organization is firstly to select resources according to the problem and the background of the problem. Resources can be regarded as all valuable things, it can be primary resources or descriptive resources, it can be tangible or intangible. The next step is to organize the resources, and then design resource-based interactions, which of course are maintained throughout their use. These activities are usually done by people such as domain experts and knowledge representation experts with the help of computers. Knowledge representation is an important part of this process. In real life, knowledge representation can be through natural language text, while in the virtual world, knowledge representation relies on database entries and UML diagrams. Meanwhile, knowledge representation emphasizes automatic reasoning, while machine learning focuses on finding patterns in data. At present, the knowledge management system includes library catalog, Wikipedia and knowledge base, etc. Through indexes, including search engine indexes and physical indexes, and collection browsing tools, we can effectively obtain the knowledge we want.

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Voida et al. [Voida et al. 2011] interviewed 23 volunteer coordinators in non-profit organizations around the organization and respondents. Through data analysis and case studies, they learned that different work environments make volunteer coordinators choose and configure different self-made databases. These work environment differences arise from information needs, diversity of stakeholders and work environments, and mobility challenges, as well as constraints on time and funding expertise. Because of these differences, home-made databases are distributed across different systems, but they all have their own disadvantages. For example, personal office application “databases” and paper-based “databases“ both have scalability and data accessibility issues, and cannot be transitioned to a single database. The above discussion provides two paths for the future development of information management and databases: one is to establish more human-centered databases, and the other is to establish standards for migrating data between applications.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter">
The unjustifiably fierce competition in web search led Bing, Google, and Yahoo to create Schema.org to improve the clutter of search results. Structured data markup based on Schema.org makes structured data easier to obtain. Schema.org has grown very successfully over the past few years, as evidenced by the high degree of adoption of schema.org tags by webmasters. The success of Org is due in part to design decisions, including support for multiple syntaxes, polymorphism, entity references, incremental complexity, and scheduled cleanup. 
And schema.org tends to be pragmatic, changing only to suit the tastes of publishers and consumers.
Considering the structured data underlying the Web, schema.org has two types of extensions, and the attention to detail brought together by the wider community through WC3 is of high importance in improving the platform.
